A basic vue+express setup, express server also acts as a proxy to vue webpack server

to start vue and backend open up 2 terminals
navigate to both the vueBase and server directories
and run npm start in server
npm start dev in vueBase

an alternative setup after building the vue is to serve it normally over express
